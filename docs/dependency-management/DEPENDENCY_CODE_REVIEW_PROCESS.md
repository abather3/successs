## Automated Review Gates

### GitHub Actions Integration

Create automated checks that must pass before human review:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/dependency-review.yml
name: Dependency Review

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**/package.json'
      - '**/package-lock.json'

jobs:
  dependency-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        
      - name: Dependency Review
        uses: actions/dependency-review-action@v3
        with:
          fail-on-severity: moderate
          
      - name: Security Audit
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm audit --audit-level=moderate
          
      - name: License Check
        run: |
          npx license-checker --onlyAllow "MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-2-Clause;BSD-3-Clause"
          
      - name: Test Suite
        run: |
          npm run test
          npm run test:integration
          
      - name: Build Check
        run: |
          npm run build
```

### Required Status Checks

Configure branch protection rules requiring these checks:
- ✅ Dependency Review
- ✅ Security Audit
- ✅ Test Suite
- ✅ Build Check
- ✅ License Check

## Review Assignment Rules

### Automatic Reviewer Assignment

Configure CODEOWNERS for automatic review assignment:

```bash
# .github/CODEOWNERS

# Dependency updates require specific reviewers
package.json @lead-developer @security-team
package-lock.json @lead-developer
*/package.json @team-leads
*/package-lock.json @team-leads

# Critical dependencies require additional review
package.json @architecture-team (if framework updates)
```

### Reviewer Expertise Matrix

| Dependency Type | Required Reviewer | Backup Reviewer |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Frontend Framework | Frontend Lead | Senior Frontend Dev |
| Backend Framework | Backend Lead | Senior Backend Dev |
| Security Libraries | Security Team | Lead Developer |
| Database Drivers | DBA/Backend Lead | Senior Backend Dev |
| Build Tools | DevOps Lead | Senior Developer |
| Testing Tools | QA Lead | Senior Developer |
