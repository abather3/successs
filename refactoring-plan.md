# CustomerManagement Refactoring Plan

## Safe Refactoring Strategy (No Breaking Changes)

### Phase 1: Extract Smaller Components (Week 1)
1. **CustomerFilters.tsx** - Extract search/filter logic
2. **CustomerActions.tsx** - Extract export buttons
3. **CustomerDialogs.tsx** - Extract view/delete dialogs

### Phase 2: Extract Complex Components (Week 2)
1. **CustomerForm.tsx** - Extract the multi-step form
2. **CustomerTable.tsx** - Extract table logic
3. **MobileCustomerCards.tsx** - Extract mobile view

### Phase 3: State Management (Week 3)
1. Create custom hooks for API calls
2. Implement useReducer for complex state
3. Add React Query for data fetching
