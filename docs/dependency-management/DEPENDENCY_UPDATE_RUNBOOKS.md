## Security Patch Deployment

### Objective

Quickly address critical vulnerabilities by deploying security patches with minimum disruption.

### Steps

1. **Security Notification**
    - Receive alert about security vulnerability.
    - Assess the impact and determine if immediate action is necessary.

2. **Hotfix Branch Creation**
    - Create a branch from `main`: `git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch-[vulnerability-id]`
    - Document the nature and severity of the vulnerability.

3. **Patch Application**
    - Apply patch to `package.json` and run `npm install`.
    - Review dependency tree for compatibility issues.

4. **Verify Changes**
    - Run basic functionality tests: `npm test`.
    - Conduct security tests: `npm audit`.
    - Ensure that changes do not affect critical features.

5. **Deploy to Staging**
    - Deploy update to staging environment.
    - Run smoke tests to confirm stability.

6. **Code Review and Approval**
    - Notify the security team and available reviewers.
    - Conduct expedited review.
    - Ensure that documentation and rollback plan are updated.

7. **Production Deployment**
    - Merge hotfix branch into `main` and deploy to production.
    - Monitor for issues post-deployment.

8. **Post-Mortem Review**
    - Analyze impact of the update.
    - Document lessons learned.

### Key Tools and Commands

```bash
# Audit security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Install specific patch version
npm install [package-name]@[version]
```

## Major Version Update Process

### Objective

Conduct a major version update ensuring minimal disruption and adherence to best practices.

### Steps

1. **Breaking Change Review**
    - Analyze release notes for breaking changes.
    - Assess the impact on the current codebase.
    - Use tools like `npx npm-check-updates` to detect changes.

2. **Environment Preparation**
    - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b update/major-[package]-[version]`
    - Ensure all development dependencies are up-to-date.

3. **Implement Changes**
    - Modify code to accommodate breaking changes.
    - Keep track of all changes in documentation.

4. **Testing**
    - Run complete suite of automated tests.
    - Perform manual testing on crucial user workflows.
    - Measure performance impact with tools like Lighthouse.

5. **Staging Deployment**
    - Test on a staging environment for unexpected issues.
    - Conduct a dry run of the deployment process.

6. **Code Review**
    - Review changes following the code review process.
    - Ensure performance, security, and adherence to standards.

7. **Production Deployment**
    - Deploy changes to production.
    - Monitor for any service disruptions or user issues.

8. **Documentation Updates**
    - Update CHANGELOG.md and relevant documentation.

### Key Tools and Commands

```bash
# Check update dependencies
npx npm-check-updates

# Run performance measurements
lighthouse [URL]
```

## Minor Version Update Process

### Objective

Efficient and safe implementation of minor version updates to benefit from incremental improvements and bug fixes.

### Steps

1. **Change Review**
    - Review release notes for minor updates.
    - Identify improvements and fixes that apply.

2. **Update Implementation**
    - Create a branch: `git checkout -b update/minor-[package]-[version]`
    - Update version in `package.json`. Run `npm install`.

3. **Run Tests**
    - Execute automated tests to check for regressions.
    - Ensure specific bug fixes/improvements are realized.

4. **Code Review**
    - Get approval from at least one reviewer specialized in the relevant scope.
    - Attach test summary results.

5. **Deployment**
    - Deploy to a staging environment and monitor.
    - Deploy to production after confirming stability.
    - Watch for anomalies in production.

6. **Post-Deployment Review**
    - Collect feedback from users if needed.
    - Update internal documentation.

### Key Tools and Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Verify integrity
npm ci
```

## Patch Version Update Process

### Objective

Implement quick, small updates for bug fixes or small-scale improvements.

### Steps

1. **Change Review**
    - Look for specific bugs or improvements targeted by the patch.
    - Evaluate minimal impact on existing functionality.

2. **Quick Implementation**
    - Create small feature branch: `git checkout -b update/patch-[package]-[version]`
    - Update version and install patch.

3. **Basic Testing**
    - Run sanity checks to ensure nothing breaks.
    - Address any immediate issues from the patch.

4. **Expedited Approval**
    - Get at least one developer's approval.
    - Clearly document any fixes and known issues.

5. **Fast-Tracked Deployment**
    - Deploy directly to production with caution.
    - Appropriate for non-critical changes only.

### Key Tools and Commands

```bash
# Quick update/install
npm update [package-name]

# Run basic test
npm test
```

## Emergency Rollback Protocols

### Objective

Swiftly revert a recent deployment that has caused significant issues or downtime.

### Steps

1. **Incident Identification**
    - Confirm issue severity and scope.
    - Consult monitoring and logging tools for insights.

2. **Rollback Preparation**
    - Locate backup or previous stable state.
    - Create temporary feature branch if needed to manage rollback.

3. **Execution**
    - Revert the deployment: `git revert [commit-hash]`.
    - Execute database/data rollback if applicable.
    - Clear caches if necessary to restore previous state.

4. **Communication**
    - Notify all stakeholders including DevOps team.
    - Update status pages and inform users where appropriate.

5. **Post-Rollback Monitoring**
    - Increase monitoring levels temporarily to detect further issues.
    - Capture data for a post-mortem report.

6. **Post-Incident Analysis**
    - Conduct a detailed analysis of what led to rollback.
    - Implement lessons learned to strengthen future deployments.

### Key Tools and Commands

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert [commit-hash]

# Rollback changes
npm install [package-name]@[previous-version]
```
