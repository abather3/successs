# Quick Test Guide for JSON Parse Error

## Current Status
- Development environment is running on `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- Backend API is working correctly (returns proper JSON with authentication errors)
- Frontend proxy is not working as expected (returns HTML instead of JSON)

## Immediate Testing Steps

### 1. Test in Browser
1. Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login with admin credentials (if you have them)
3. Try to access:
   - Queue Management
   - Display Monitor  
   - Historical Analytics
4. Check browser console for JSON parse errors

### 2. Check Browser Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try to access Queue Management
4. Look for API calls (should be `/api/queue/*`)
5. Check if responses are JSON or HTML

### 3. Test Authentication
1. After logging in, check localStorage:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.getItem('accessToken')
   ```
2. Should return a JWT token string

### 4. Manual API Test with Token
1. Copy the access token from localStorage
2. Test API with authentication:
   ```bash
   # Replace TOKEN_HERE with actual token
   docker exec escashop_backend_dev curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN_HERE" http://localhost:5000/api/queue/all-statuses
   ```

## Expected Results

### ✅ If Working Correctly:
- Browser shows application pages without console errors
- Network tab shows API calls returning JSON responses
- Queue Management, Display Monitor, and Historical Analytics load data

### ❌ If Still Having Issues:
- JSON parse errors in browser console
- API calls in Network tab return HTML instead of JSON
- Pages show "failed to fetch queue data" messages

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If Authentication is Working:
The issue is resolved - users just need to login properly.

### If Still Getting HTML Responses:
The proxy configuration needs additional fixes. We may need to:
1. Update the React development server proxy configuration
2. Add a custom proxy middleware
3. Switch to a different approach for API routing

## Alternative Solution
If the proxy continues to fail, we can:
1. Configure the frontend to make direct calls to `http://localhost:5000/api`
2. Update CORS settings on the backend
3. Handle cross-origin requests properly

Let me know what you see when testing in the browser!
